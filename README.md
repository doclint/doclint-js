# doclint

> A documentation linter to help make your documentation better

## Working locally with the project

1. First clone the repository to your local working environment.
2. Navigate to the cloned folder and run `npm i`.
3. After the required packages are installed, run `npm link` to create a symlink for the doclint command on your local environment.
4. Try the options available by running `doclint --init` or `doclint -i`. This will give you an interactive shell to generate your own doclint configuration file. If you get an error saying the file exists, delete the `doclintrc.js` or `doclintrc` or `doclint.json` file in the directory.

> This project is still in the beta phase hence a lot of the linting part of the tool is currently not up in the repository. Please take a look at the [RoadMap](/ROADMAP.md) to see where the project is headed. Do raise issues if you have opinions about anything you believe would be of importance.
